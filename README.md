# System Performance Monitoring using Linux

## Overview
This project demonstrates basic system performance monitoring in a Linux environment using command-line utilities. The purpose was to assess system health by analyzing CPU usage, memory consumption, disk utilization, and uptime.

## Environment
- Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- Oracle VirtualBox

## Objectives
- Monitor CPU activity
- Check memory usage
- Analyze disk space utilization
- Determine system uptime and load

## Commands Used

### 1. CPU Monitoring
Command used: top

Displays real-time CPU usage and running processes.

### 2. Memory Usage
Command used: free -h

Shows total, used, and available memory in human-readable format.

### 3. Disk Utilization
Command used: df -h

Displays disk usage statistics for mounted file systems.

### 4. System Uptime
Command used: uptime

Shows how long the system has been running and current load.

## Observations
- CPU usage was within normal range
- Memory usage was stable
- Sufficient disk space was available
- System load indicated normal operation

## Conclusion
This project provided practical experience in monitoring system performance and diagnosing potential resource issues, which are essential tasks in IT Support and NOC environments.
